# Introduction

Since CPA open-source the [Unlight](https://github.com/unlightcpa/Unlight) source code in 2019 but didn't continue maintenance it, we fork a copy as [Open Unlight](https://unlight.app) as community version.

Currently, we are focused on the server-side as a new project inherits from the Unlight server named Dawn. The client-side is under development based on the Unity Engine and will coming soon.

## Dawn

The Unlight server written in Ruby.

> To be announced in 2020 later.

## Phantom

The Unlight client based on the Unity Engine.
